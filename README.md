# GradleFileReader



Prerequisites:
Install Gradle & HSQLDB (JDBC Connection)

===========================================

Step 1: Create a Gradle project in Eclipse (Find out how to run app from Command Line)

Step 2: Read in an example JSON text file (Gson Library - JsonReader)

Step 3: Parse the contents of the file into POJO's (Event) - (Gson Library)

Step 4: Write code that flag's event's longer than 4ms based on timestamp field in JSON - "the timestamp of the event is in milliseconds"



Note to Reviewer:
=============================================
I had some difficulty installing both Gradle & HSQLDB (I've never used either)

Given more time I would have learned more about Gradle & HSQLDB, and would have fixed the bugs I have in the insertEvents method in Application.java. Also I would have written some unit tests.


Thank you for your consideration, I have learned a lot from this test.

Kind regards
Suzanne Murphy
